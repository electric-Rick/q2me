# Build phase

  Yay! At @UFRRJ some students wanna make some questions to another one and they don't have any option to do it. I know which exists another ways to do this simple app, but the objective it will delivery a good option to all persons make your questions in privacy and publics ways. 
  
  This great(or not so great) idea comes to me and I'll do that with Ruby on Rails.
  There's an build phase, at this phase changes will be necessary in future by another persons(or only me if this thing don't make sense).
  
  This app already has a prototype, but the "view" aren't OK, so a new one will be needed.

# About
This application allow users to make questions for another users or post somewhat they're want.
